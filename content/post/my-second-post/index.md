Now that I’ve successfully defended my dissertation (no take-backs!), I can share some thoughts about developing a personality structure. 

Analytically, validating an approach to developing a structure has been under-appreciated. Often, authors testing a new approach will identify a structure of personality as a mere proof-of-concept.

Serendipitously, a paper by Samo et al. (2025) just came out using the methods I would suggest for such a task. If anything, theirs are even slicker. While it wasn’t a lexical study, many of the same considerations apply.

Foremost, when we tend do this work, we’re effectively generating an average structure of personality based on cross-sectional variable associations. However, that’s not only way of doing things nor is it a one-size-fits-all approach—for a ton more nuance on personality research design, see Kuper et al. (2024). I can nitpick such models, but that's not the point I want to make here.

Quantitative psychologists are doing a great job giving us methods for personality assessment. Personality psychologists should be considering the variables defining personality. If you select variables based on some theoretical domains, you can reasonably expect to recover those domains through dimension reduction (which is often good—it’s fundamental for psychological scaling). However, this means that the scope of variables that define personality is critical.

Further, when we move away from lexical structures (which I'm not against), an intractably vast number of options for personality traits opens up. I don't have a great solution to this dilemma. Many traits (e.g. self-efficacy) can be an area of study unto themselves. Other traits are scientifically nascent or even unidentified. Our trait taxonomy will involve researcher decision, so it should also involve researcher discussion.

In the mean time, it seems to me that personality measurement is what you intend to use it for. Often, personality is measured as an afterthought; a covariate, not something to spend much time measuring. I'd rather see psychologists move away from high-bandwidth traits towards more specific traits that have a stronger link to the research question at hand.
