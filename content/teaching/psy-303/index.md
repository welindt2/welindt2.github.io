## Course Description

A foundational course in statistical methods for psychology, building on Scientific Thinking (PSY 301) and Research Methods (PSY 303). This course focuses on building skills as a producer of research and as a critical consumer of psychological research. analyses using APA style. Using existing data sets students develop hypotheses based on a review of relevant literature, analyze the data to test those hypotheses, then write up, revise, and present the results of that work in two short research reports. The final written products included a correlational research study and a related experimental research study.

## My Responsibilities as a GE

- Held regular office hours to help students with methodological concepts, literature reviews, and assignments
- Led weekly sections to teach research methods, academic writing, and statistical analyses
- Provided support for weekly homework assignments and long-term projects
- Helped students troubleshoot research questions
- Graded assignments

## Course Components

I supported students across multiple learning activities:

- **Homework assignments** (15%): Weekly data analysis problems
- **Presentation** (10%): Interactive exercises during lectures
- **Participation** (15%): Interactive exercises during lectures
- **Papers** (60%--25% correlational, 35% experimental)

## Teaching Approach

In lab sections, I emphasized conceptual understanding alongside best practices in research and academic writing. I worked to provide a framework and concrete steps for investigating psychological constructs and reporting those findings in academic style.

## Skills Developed

Teaching research strengthened my own qualitative skills, especially literature reviews and providing formative feedback of a research proposal. This also strengthened my ability to simplify and communicate abstract concepts for a non-expert audience.
